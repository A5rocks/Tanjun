# Tanjun

A flexible command framework designed to extend Hikari.

# Instillation

You can install Tanjun from PyPI using the following command.

```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari.git git+https://github.com/FasterSpeeding/Tanjun.git
```

> **WARNING**: Since @master targets Hikari's @master you'll have to ensure
if you don't also explicitly include Hikari in the install call then it will fail.

> **NOTE**: Pip installing straight from @master is a temporary approach which
should be avoided once Hikari starts making regular releases again.


# Quick Usage.
